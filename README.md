# Raccoon's Reckoning

This is a simple blog to primarily log my days. 

### About
A brief introduction and links to my social network websites.

### Development Logs
I would like to organize my learnings from my development journey and keep myself motivated and moving. This will require lots of help and valuable feedback, so you're welcome to share your thoughts but please be nice.

### Personal Diary
I've been meaning to write a diary for a while now, except my fingers kept hurting from writing. This will be my own space to reflect on my days.
